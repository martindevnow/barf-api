# B.A.R.F. Bento

B.A.R.F. Bento stands for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. \
This is the standard for the ideal diet for dogs and cats as well as other household pets. 

Too often, pet owners are misinformed by mass media and so, without knowing better, they feed their pets a 
diet consisting primarily of grains and other carbohydrates which their stomachs are not equipped to 
digest properly. This can lead to significant complications later in life for your pets. 

As such, it is strongly recommended that pets be fed a B.A.R.F. diet.
